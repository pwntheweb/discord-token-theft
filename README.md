# discord-token-theft
Steal Discord tokens! (discord plz fix)  
This repo is just as a barebones example. It is raw and unclean but it works. It is meant for you to modify it as your own.
<br /><br />
<h2>Method 1: discord-infect</h2><br />
Infects Discord installation. You do not need to have a seperate program scan files repeatedly for updates.<br />
Pros:<br />
 - Once launched only Discord is required to be open to operate.<br />
Cons:<br />
 - Requires Discord to restart before it starts working.<br />
 - Can be solved by uninstalling Discord.
<br /><br />
<h2>Method 2: file-crawl</h2><br />
Searches Discord installation's localdb for tokens.<br />
Pros:<br />
 - Somewhat more secret, does not need to change Discord's operating status.<br />
 - Does not require discord to be launched.<br />
Cons:<br />
 - Requires a seperate program to be running to get information.
